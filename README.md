# Potts Model Markov Chain Monte Carlo
The following code is a simple monte-carlo simulation of the Potts Model Hamiltonian. The ising model is a rite of passage for any aspiring computational/theorectical physicist. 
In this code, we consider a more general form of the ising model in which the hamiltonian is provided as:
```math
$$H_P=-J_P\sum_{\braket{i,j}}\delta_{s_i,s_i}$$
```
More information and results regarding the critical temperature, $$T_c$$, of the said simulation can be found in the report found in this repo.
